# Advanced Database Concepts and Optimization Techniques

This project focuses on advanced database concepts and practices to optimize query performance and enhance data retrieval efficiency in a complex Airbnb-like database schema.

## Key Highlights

### 1. Complex Queries with Joins

Gain expertise in SQL joins with tasks that require combining multiple tables to extract meaningful insights. Learners explore INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN for various scenarios.

### 2. Power of Subqueries

Develop proficiency with both correlated and non-correlated subqueries. Learn how to nest queries for advanced data analysis, such as calculating average ratings or filtering users based on activity thresholds.

### 3. Aggregations and Window Functions

Unlock analytical capabilities using SQL aggregation functions like COUNT and SUM. Dive into advanced window functions like ROW_NUMBER and RANK to rank and analyze data sets.

### 4. Indexing for Optimization

Identify performance bottlenecks and write SQL commands to create indexes for frequently queried columns. They analyze the impact of these changes on query execution times.

### 5. Query Optimization Techniques

Write and analyze complex queries for retrieving detailed information about bookings, properties, users, and payments. Refactor queries to improve execution times by reducing redundancies and leveraging indexing.

### 6. Partitioning Large Tables

Address performance challenges with large datasets by implementing table partitioning. Focus on partitioning the Booking table to improve queries on date ranges and compare performance before and after partitioning.

### 7. Performance Monitoring and Schema Refinement

Learners monitor query performance using SHOW PROFILE and EXPLAIN ANALYZE, identify bottlenecks, and propose schema changes. Practical tasks include implementing these adjustments and documenting results.
