- **Testing**: PyTest, Postman - For unit testing and API testing.
- **Documentation**: Markdown, OpenAPI - For project documentation and API documentation.

## Database Design

The core entities for the Airbnb Clone Project are:

### Users

- **Fields**: `id, name, email, password_hash, date_joined`
- **Description**: Represents a person using the platform. A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

### Properties

- **Fields**: `id, owner_id (User), title, description, location, price_per_night`
- **Description**: Represents a property listed for rent. Each property is owned by a user.

### Bookings

- **Fields**: `id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status`
- **Description**: Represents a reservation made by a user for a property.

### Reviews

- **Fields**: `id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, created_at`
- **Description**: Represents feedback left by a user for a property after a booking.

### Payments

- **Fields**: `id, booking_id, amount, payment_date, status`
- **Description**: Represents payment transactions for bookings.

#### Entity Relationships

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.
- A **Booking** can have one **Payment**.

## Feature Breakdown

### API Documentation

- **OpenAPI Standard**: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
- **GraphQL**: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

### User Authentication

- **Endpoints**: `/users/, /users/{user_id}/`
- **Features**: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

### Property Management

- **Endpoints**: `/properties/, /properties/{property_id}/`
- **Features**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### Booking System

- **Endpoints**: `/bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/`
- **Features**: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

### Payment Processing

- **Endpoints**: `/payments/`
- **Features**: Handle payment transactions related to bookings. This includes processing payments, recording transaction details, and managing payment statuses.

### Review System

- **Endpoints**: `/reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/`
- **Features**: Post and manage reviews for properties.

### Database Optimization

- **Indexing**: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- **Caching**: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.
- **Query Optimization**: Optimize database queries to enhance performance and reduce latency.
- **Data Archiving**: Implement data archiving strategies for old bookings and reviews to maintain database performance.
- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.

## API Security

Key security measures implemented in this project include:

- **Authentication**: Ensures only registered users can access protected resources by verifying user identities through secure methods such as JWT or OAuth.
- **Authorization**: Controls access to specific actions and data, ensuring users can only perform operations permitted by their roles (e.g., only property owners can modify their listings).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and denial-of-service attacks by restricting the number of requests a user or client can make within a set timeframe.
- **Data Validation & Sanitization**: Protects against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting by validating and sanitizing all user inputs.
- **Secure Payment Processing**: Integrates with trusted payment gateways and encrypts sensitive transaction data to safeguard financial information.

Security is crucial for protecting user data, maintaining trust, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. It also secures payment transactions, prevents unauthorized access, and helps maintain the integrity and availability of the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Overview of CI/CD

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a software development practice that automates the building, testing, and deployment of applications.

- **Continuous Integration** involves automatically building and testing code changes whenever developers push to the repository, ensuring early detection of integration issues.

- **Continuous Deployment** automatically deploys successfully tested code changes to staging or production environments, enabling rapid and reliable releases.

### Importance for This Project

- **Automated Testing**: Every change is automatically tested, maintaining code quality

- **Rapid Feedback**: Immediate notification of build failures or test errors

- **Consistent Deployments**: Standardized, repeatable deployment processes

- **Reduced Risk**: Smaller, more frequent releases minimize deployment risks

- **Team Collaboration**: Ensures all changes integrate smoothly with the main codebase

### Pipeline Tools

- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the CI/CD workflows directly within the GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: To create consistent environments for building, testing, and deploying the application.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration for container deployment

- **AWS CodePipeline**: Cloud-native CI/CD service on AWS

- **Azure DevOps**: Microsoft's comprehensive CI/CD platform
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database for storing application data.
- **Django**: The web framework used for building the backend application.

### Pipeline Stages

The typical CI/CD workflow includes:

- **Code Commit** → Developers push changes to feature branches

- **Build** → Compile code and resolve dependencies

- **Test** → Run automated tests (unit, integration, e2e)

- **Security Scan** → Vulnerability and code quality checks

- **Deploy to Staging** → Automatic deployment to test environment

- **Manual Approval** → Optional gate for production deployment

- **Deploy to Production** → Release to live environment
